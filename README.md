# CS210TermProject - Spotify Data Analysis
This repository includes all required files related to my CS210 term project about my Spotify data. I have downloaded my spotify data between November of 2022 and November of 2023 from the services that Spotify provide for their users so, no web scraping has been done.

## Getting Started
*THE DATA SOURCE*
Spotify

*DATA ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES*
EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis), visualizations and machine learning models are implemented for the data.

*MOTIVATION & AIM*

*CONTENT OF DATA*
The original dataset includes a 2248 rows Ã— 4 columns matrix. The first column indicates when I listened to that music, the second column contains the artist's name, the third column contains the track name, and the fourth one includes the milliseconds listened to that song. I have made some changes to the dataframe, which are outlined in the Cs210SpotiDataProject.py file itself, to further investigate my dataframe.

## Requirements
This project requires Python 3.x and the following dependencies:
- pandas==1.3.3
- json==2.0.9
- matplotlib==3.4.3
- seaborn==0.11.2
- scikit-learn==0.24.2

To install all the dependencies, use the following command in a clean virtual environment:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt


### Installing

* Copy over the repository and work in there.

### Executing program

* Run the program by running `Cs210SpotiDataProject.py`. After some time a user can inspect the file with their inputs on the bottom of each code segment.
* User can inspect the original .json file located in the repository named StreamingHistorySezerKocaekiz.json file

## TO-DO

* Machine learning model in the code can be improved by some tweaking in the hyperparameters tuning.
